H2: DREAM TEAM

H1: About Gullu

Gullu is not just another social network ! It's a passion project that has been in development for several years. Our team of experienced developers and designers has worked tirelessly to create a platform that is both functional and intuitive.

At Gullu, we believe that travel is a life-enriching experience that creates lasting connections between people. We want to offer travelers a unique experience, combining the features of a social network with those of a travel application. We are proud to offer an application that allows travelers to stay in touch with their friends from all over the world, no matter where they are. Our goal is to create lasting connections between travelers, so that everyone can benefit from a global network of friends.

My name is Guillaume, and I'm the founder of Gullu. I've been a globetrotter since 2019. While traveling, I felt so bad about losing the beautiful and meaningful relationships I created around the world. So during my stay in India I decided to realize my dream and create my own app because I needed it. And now, it's finally downloaded on my phone, I am so proud to share it with all of you!

I am Maxime, CTO of Gullu. I am a passionate full-stack developer and traveler who has been working on Gullu since the beginning. I am here to make Gullu come to life and make your experience extraordinary!

Erevna Enterprise is a skillful Indian developers team. They managed to transform a traveler's dream into reality.

Together with Jordan Zucchiatti Designer Graphique we created the visual Identity of the brand. Thanks to his professional and creative mind, he designed the universe around Gullu.
